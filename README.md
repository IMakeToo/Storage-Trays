# Storage-Trays
Parametric shallow trays sized to fit evenly inside specified drawer dimensions.

Open the file in Fusion 360 and enter the widths and front-to-back lengths of the drawer and tray listed under Favorites in Parameters.

Designed for fast printing with a 1.2 mm nozzle and 0.6 mm layer height. Probably prints fine with a smaller nozzle, but not tested.

The tray walls are 1.2 mm thick, so when printing with a 1.2 mm nozzle you may need to experiment with print profile settings to print successfully. I achieved good results using SuperSlicer.
